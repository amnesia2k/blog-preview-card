## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learnt how to style a Box-Shadow, here is the sample code of the Box-Shadow style that i used;

```css
.big-box {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 black;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing Media Queries because i am not yet proficient with it.

### Useful resources
